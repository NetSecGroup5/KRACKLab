  == KRACK attacks: Key Reinstallation Attack

  = Key Reinstallation Attack in a simulated environment

  == Environment replication
  
  The second exercise of the 4#super("th") laboratory consisted in a replication of the attack in a simulated environment created by Mininet-WiFi@mnwifi, a wireless network simulation software. The laboratory also uses a modified version of the `krack-test-client.py` script@script that Mathy Vanhoef created to test if a client was vulnerable to the Key Reinstallation Attack: in this version only the packet number and the eventual installation of an all-0 key would be tested.
  Apart from a vulnerable wpa_supplicant, a "compatible" Linux Kernel, like 4.4.0, has to be installed too, otherwise the script made by Mathy Vanhoef will say the supplicant is not vulnerable due to modification that were introduced in Linux.

  To summarize,the exercise require the following software:

    ),

  )

  After installing the operating system, the most straightforward way to install everything that is needed is by cloning the laboratory repository@repo with the command:
  ```shell-unix-generic
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NetSecGroup5/KRACKLab.git
  ```
  This will automatically clone both the script and configuration files for the exercise, as well as the correct Mininet-WiFi repository and the original KRACK test scripts. After that, it is possible to install Mininet-WiFi by running, from the Mininet-WiFi folder located under `lab/ex2/mininet-wifi` of our git repository, the following command:
  ```shell-unix-generic
    sudo util/install.sh -Wlnfv
  ```

  Next, in order to prepare the environment necessary for executing the modified script, run, from the folder in `lab/ex2/krackattacks-script/krackattacks` the following two scripts:
  ```shell-unix-generic
      ./build.sh
      ./pysetup.sh
  ```

  Next, extract the source code of wpa_supplicant version 2.3, navigate to the wpa_supplicant folder, and, after generating the configuration files with `cp defconfig .config`, modify the file by uncommenting `CONFIG_LIBNL32=y` (a library needed for the compilation) and inserting the line `CONFIG_TLS=internal` (to allow compilation with the most recent openssl library, otherwise an older version would be required). Next, run `make` and copy the compiled executable inside the `lab/ex2` folder of our repository, renaming it in `wpa_supplicant23`.

  Finally, after installing Wireshark via `apt` or download and configuring it to decrypt WLAN messaging by adding `abcdefgh:testnetwork` (password and SSID of the compromised wireless Access Point, respectively) in `Edit > Preferences > Protocols > IEEE 802.11 > Decryption keys > new field > Key Type`, download the 4.4.0 Linux Kernel and relative headers, the install them by running:

  ```shell-unix-generic
  sudo dpkg -i linux*.deb
  ```

  Lastly, adjust your boot loader settings in order to boot with the older Kernel: it is now possible to run the 2#super("nd") exercise wizard.

  It is possible to read a step-by-step guide on the laboratory repository@repo.

  == Testing with the wizard

  In order to ease the execution of the exercise, a graphical wizard was created to guide students through the various step. Executing it will allow to easily create the necessary network topology with Mininet-WiFi, made of two wireless network station, *fakeAp*, that will execute the modified testing script, and *sta1*, which will represent the victim.

  It is necessary to spend a few words to talk about the script: in summary, what it does is creating, by taking control over fakeAp wireless network card, an access point using *hostapd*, a software specifically designed for this task, modified in order for it to drop message 4 packets of the handshake so that it will automatically generate valid message 3 packets that the script will forward to *sta1*. Every message 4 is then analyzed to understand if an all-0 key has been reinstalled (by trying to decrypt the message) or if a packet number already used was, indeed, used again.

  The wizard will then make the user open a shell for fakeAp (to activate the script as just described by running a custom script called `startAttack.sh`, which copy the modified version of the script in the `krackattacks\krackattack` folder, the right hosatpd configuration in the `krackattacks\hostapd` folder, for then activating a python environment and running the script) and one for sta1 (to make the virtual device connect to the script network via a vulnerable instance of wpa_supplicant, all is possible using an appropriate configuration, see the `wifiConfig.conf` file, and the command `./wpa_supplicant23 -i sta1-wlan0 -c "wifiConfig.conf"`): as it is possible to read in @results, the script will correctly tell the user that sta1 re-used a packet number, indicating that the key reinstallation was successful.

  In order to better see the packet number re-use, the wizard invite the user to open Wireshark (which is automatically configured to capture only the packets of interest) and execute some `ping` to the Access Point with `sta1 ping -c 14 192.168.100.254` (this being the IP address of fakeAp): see @results for the results.
