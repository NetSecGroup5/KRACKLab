  = Introduction

  == KRACK attacks: Key Reinstallation Attack <intro>

  The KRACK attacks are a series of vulnerabilities that target both clients connected to Access Points and Access Points themselves: in this report one of them in particular will be discussed, that being the reinstallation of the *Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)* on a vulnerable client.

  Generally, in order to encrypt messages between clients and the Access Point, a *4-way handshake* is performed, as shown in the first four messages in the following @scheme:

  #grid(
    columns:(50%,50%),
    [
      #figure(
        image("img/Mtt/scheme.png", width: 70%),
        caption: [KRACK attack scheme, "Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2" by Mathy Vanhoef@krackattackpaper]
      )#label("scheme")
    ],
    [
      *First*, the Access Point (called _"Authenticator"_), sends a message to the client (called _"Supplicant"_), containing a random nonce and a replay counter (_ANonce_ and _r_, respectively). The client uses the *ANonce*, together with the *Pairwise Master Key (PMK)*, another newly generated nonce (called _"SNonce"_) and the client and Access Point MAC addresses, to generate the PTK, that is later divided into sub-keys: the *Key Encryption Key (KEK)*, to encrypt the *Group Temporal Key (GTK)*, a key that protect messages the Access Point sends to its client, when this is delivered to newly connected client; the *Key Confirmation Key (KCK)*, that is used for integrity of the messages of this handshake, and the *Temporal Key (TK)*, used to protect data packets sent to the Access Point from the client with some ciphers like *CCMP*.
    ]
  )

  After that, the client sends, with the *second message* of the handshake, the *SNonce* to the Access Point (but not before securing the message for *integrity* using the *KCK*. Notice that all messages of the handshake from the second have an integrity check). *Then* the Access Point sends the *GTK* to the client, together with a command for the client to install the *PTK*. Finally, the client acknowledges the third message by sending a *fourth message* to the Access Point: this will make the Access Point install the *PTK*.

  Now, the problem: if another third message arrives to the client, this will make the client *reinstall the PTK* and *reset the packet counter*, an element used in *CCMP* to generate keystreams that are always different. What was just described is precisely what happens in the KRACK attack: why this is problematic is explained in @consequences.

  Specifically, the Access Point usually runs a software called *hostapd* to create a wireless network, while the client uses another application, called *wpa_supplicant*, in order for it to be able to connect to Access Points: the KRACK vulnerability has been patched in modern versions of wpa_supplicant, however *versions* like *2.3* are *still vulnerable* to what was just described since the *patch* was *not backported*.

  Finally, some versions of wpa_supplicant had a worse problem: for example, in *version 2.5* a change introduced probably in the effort of satisfying a suggestion in the 802.11 standard *caused*, upon reception of a repeated third message of the handshake, the *installation* of an *all-0 key*, _de facto_ providing *no confidentiality* over packets sent.

  = Key Reinstallation Attack in a simulated environment

  == Environment replication
  
  The *second exercise* of the 4#super("th") laboratory consisted in a replication of the attack in a *simulated environment* created using *Mininet-WiFi*@mnwifi, a wireless network simulation software. The laboratory also used a modified version of the  test  script `krack-test-client.py`@script that Mathy Vanhoef created to check whether a client was vulnerable to the Key Reinstallation Attack: in this version, only the *packet number* and the *eventual installation* of an *all-0 key* would be *tested*.
  In addition to a vulnerable wpa_supplicant, a "compatible" *Linux Kernel*, like *4.4.0*, needs also to be *installed*: if not, *the script will state that the supplicant is not vulnerable* due to various modifications introduced in Linux.

  To summarize, the exercise requires the following software:

  #figure(
    table(
      align: center+horizon,
      columns: (33%,33%,33%),
      table.header([*Program*],[*Version* or *Commit ID*],[*Source*]),
      [*Mininet-WiFi*], [Commit 070ea2d], [Official Mininet-WiFi website@mnwifi],
      [*Official KRACK testing scripts by Mathy Vanhoef*], [Commit 2dc8012], [Official repository for the script@script],
      [*wpa_supplicant*], [2.3], [Official website of wpa_supplicant@wpa_sup],
      [*Xubuntu (Operating System)*], [24.04.4 (minimal)], [Xubuntu official website@xubuntu],
      [*Modified `krack-test-client.py` script, exercise wizard and other configuration files*], [1.0], [Official GitHub repository of the fourth laboratory of the Network Security class @ UniTn (2025/26)@repo],
      [*Linux Kernel (and relative headers)*], [4.4.0-040400], [Ubuntu Linux Kernel 4.4 official download page@kernel4.4],
      [*Wireshark*], [4.6.4], [Official Wireshark website@wireshark]
    ),
    caption: [Environment requirements] 
  )

  After installing the operating system, the most straightforward way to setup everything needed is by cloning the laboratory repository@repo with the following command:
  ```shell-unix-generic
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NetSecGroup5/KRACKLab.git
  ```
  This will clone both the script and configuration files needed for the exercise, as well as the correct Mininet-WiFi repository and the original KRACK test scripts. After that, it is possible to install Mininet-WiFi by running, from the Mininet-WiFi folder located under *`lab/ex2/mininet-wifi`* of the cloned repository, the following command:
  ```shell-unix-generic
    sudo util/install.sh -Wlnfv
  ```

  Next, in order to compile a modified version of *hostapd* that rejects messages 4 of the handshake and to prepare the environment necessary for executing the modified script, run, from the folder in *`lab/ex2/krackattacks-script/krackattacks`* the following two scripts:
  ```shell-unix-generic
      ./build.sh
      ./pysetup.sh
  ```

  Next, extract the source code of wpa_supplicant version 2.3, navigate to the wpa_supplicant folder, and, after generating the configuration files with *`cp defconfig .config`*, modify such *`.config`* file by uncommenting *`CONFIG_LIBNL32=y`* (a library needed for the compilation) and inserting the line *`CONFIG_TLS=internal`* (to allow compilation with the most recent openssl library, otherwise an older version would be required). Then, run *`make`* and copy the compiled executable inside the *`lab/ex2`* folder of our repository, renaming it in *`wpa_supplicant23`*.

  Finally, after installing Wireshark and configuring it to decrypt WLAN messages by adding *`abcdefgh:testnetwork`* (*passphrase* and *SSID* of the wireless network, respectively) in *`Edit > Preferences > Protocols > IEEE 802.11 > Decryption keys > new field > Key Type`*, download the *4.4.0 Linux Kernel* and relative headers, then install them by running:

  ```shell-unix-generic
  sudo dpkg -i linux*.deb
  ```

  Lastly, adjust your boot loader settings in order to boot with the older Kernel. It is now possible to run the 2#super("nd") exercise wizard by executing in a terminal the command:

  ```shell-unix-generic
  sudo python3 ex2.py
  ```

  A side note: it is possible to read a step-by-step guide on the laboratory repository@repo.

  == Testing with the wizard

  #figure(
    image("img/Mtt/script.png", width: 40%),
    caption: [Interactive wizard - step 2 of 8]
  )

  In order to ease the execution of the exercise, a graphical wizard was created to guide students through the various steps. Executing it will allow to easily create the necessary network topology with Mininet-WiFi, made of two wireless stations: *fakeAp*, which will execute the modified testing script, and *sta1*, which will represent the victim. A diagram of the attack is displayed in @scheme.

  The modified script will create, by taking control of *fakeAp wireless network card*, an Access Point using the modified *hostapd* program: since it will drop all fourth messages of the handshake, it will be forced to *generate valid message 3 packets* that the script will then forward to *sta1*. *Every message 4* is, however, still *analyzed* in order to understand if an *all-0 key was installed* (by trying to decrypt the message) or if a *packet number* already used was, indeed, *used again*.

  The *wizard* will then make the user *open a shell for fakeAp* (used to activate the modified test script by running *`startAttack.sh`*, which *copy* the modified *test script* in the *`krackattacks\` `krackattack`* folder and the *hostapd configuration* in the *`krackattacks\hostapd`* folder, *activate* a needed *python environment* and, finally, *runs* the *test script*) and one for *sta1* (used to make the *device* *connect* to the *test script network* via a *vulnerable* instance of *wpa_supplicant*; this is possible by using an appropriate configuration, contained in the *`wifiConfig.conf`* file, and the command *`./wpa_supplicant23 -i sta1-wlan0 -c "wifiConfig.conf"`*): as it is possible to read in @results, the script will correctly tell the user that sta1 reused a packet number, indicating that the key reinstallation was successful.

  In order to better *see* the *packet number reuse*, the wizard suggests, on the second step, opening *Wireshark* (which is automatically configured to capture only the packets of interest, these being EAPOL and ICMP packets) and executing, during the final step, some *`ping`* to the Access Point by executing *`sta1 ping -c 14 192.168.100.254`* (this being the IP address of fakeAp): see @results for the results.

  
  == Results <results>

  #figure(
    kind: image,
    grid(
      columns: (50%,50%),
      align: center+horizon,
      [#image("img/Mtt/scriptResult.png", width: 100%)],[#image("img/Mtt/wireshark.png", width: 85%)],
    ),
    caption: [Attack results on the modified script and on Wireshark with wpa_supplicant v2.3]
  )#label("result")

  After activating the modified KRACK test script and making sta1 connect to fakeAp, the attack results are immediately visible on the fakeAp shell: in fact, the *test script* will quickly advise the user that *a nonce was reused*, as visible in the leftmost picture in @result.

  The *effect* just described is also perfectly visible on the *Wireshark capture*: as reported in the rightmost picture in @result, in the *"CCMP Packet Number" column* (which is, as explained in @consequences, the *nonce used by* the stream cipher *CCMP*), by looking at the *first pink block* it is possible to *notice* how every *ping message sent by sta1* has a *growing number from 1 to 5* but, *after retransmission* of the *third message* of the handshake *and*, consequently, *the reinstallation of the key*, the *second pink block of messages* start again to be *numbered from 1*, unequivocal signature of a successful attack. 

  #figure(
    image("img/Mtt/scriptResult25.png", width: 41%),
    caption: "Attack result on the modified script with wpa_supplicant v2.5"
  )#label("result2")

  The modified script is also able to detect if a worse effect of the attack happened: specifically, the *installation of an all-0 key*. As described in @intro, this is the case when *wpa_supplicant* version *2.5* is running: in @result2 it is possible to see such vulnerability being *detected* by the modified *test script*.

  = Consequences of the attack <consequences>

  The *802.11i standard* allows the usage of two different protocols for data *confidentiality*: *TKIP* and *CCMP*, both based on *stream ciphers*, which are a type of algorithm that encrypts messages with a *XOR* (*$xor$*) operation *between* the *plaintext* and a generated *keystream*. However, *security is guaranteed* only *if* the *keystream always changes* and *does not contain predictable* (_biased_) *sections*.

  In case of *TKIP*, a *stream cipher* called *RC4* is *used*, which is *notoriously known to produce a biased keystream* and this is one of the reasons why TKIP is now *deprecated* (see the *RC4 NOMORE* vulnerability@rc4nomore, which was also discovered by Mathy Vanhoef).

  On the other hand, *CCMP* uses *AES*, a *block cipher* (therefore, an algorithm that divides the plaintext into blocks and encrypts each of them via various operations), in *CCM mode*: the *keystream is guaranteed to be unique as long as*, under the same starting key, *the Initalization Vector (IV)*, a combination of the sender MAC, some flags and a 48-bit nonce which is usually just the packet number in most implementations of CCMP, *is not repeated*.

  The reason why it is essential for stream ciphers to not encrypt using the same keystream is related to how the XOR operator works. Considering *P* and *P'* as *P*\laintexts and *K* as the *K*\eystrem, *C*\iphertexts *C* and *C'* are obtained by computing *P $xor$ K* and *P' $xor$ K*. Going back is a matter of computing: *P = C $xor$ K* and *P' = C' $xor$ K*.
  
  However, the following operation can be performed: 
  #align(center)[
    #grid(
      columns: (20%,5%,20%,5%,20%,5%,20%),
      align: horizon+center,
      grid.cell(align: right)[*C $xor$ C'*],[$arrow.r.filled$],[*(P $xor$ K) $xor$ (P' $xor$ K)*],grid.cell(align: right)[$arrow.r.filled$],[*P $xor$ K $xor$ P' $xor$ K*],[$arrow.r.filled$],grid.cell(align: left)[*K $xor$ K $xor$ P' $xor$ P*]
    )
  ]
  
  Two XOR properties need now to be mentioned. Given a random value A:
  #align(center)[
      #grid(
      columns: (50%,50%),
      [*A $xor$ A = 0*],[*0 $xor$ A = A*]
    )
  ]

  Therefore, these further operations can be performed:

  #align(center)[
    #grid(
      columns: (30%,5%,30%,5%,30%),
      [*K $xor$ K $xor$ P' $xor$ P*], [$arrow.r.filled$], [*0 $xor$ P' $xor$ P*], [$arrow.r.filled$], [*C $xor$ C'* = *P' $xor$ P*]
    )
  ]

  If *P* and *P'* are two common network packets, *they will both contain frames of common protocols* (like TCP, for example), which are *highly predictable*. Therefore, since it is possible to easily guess correctly at least a portion of, for example, *P'*, such knowledge can be used to perform the operation *P' $xor$ C $xor$ C'*, which will output at least a portion of the content of *P*.

  The *Key Reinstallation Attack causes* a reinstallation of the PTK and, consequently, *a reset of the packet number* used in the *IV* of *CCMP*: based on what was just discussed, a simple *capture of packets* before and after the reinstallation *is sufficient* to be able *to decrypt at least a portion of one of them*: given the normal web traffic, nowadays over HTTPS, this will not make it possible to decrypt the payload of the majority of packets, but it is still a *very important vulnerability if non-encrypting protocols are used*.

  As briefly mentioned in @intro, it has been discovered that *wpa_supplicant* versions *2.4* and *2.5* have a far more dangerous vulnerability: in order to be compliant with the 802.11 standard, they clear the temporal key from memory once it has been installed. *This causes the installation of an all-0 key* during the attack, *breaking stream ciphers' assumption of a non-predictable keystream* and allowing easy decryption of encrypted wireless messages.

  Finally, it was discovered that *all Android 6.0 devices* were shipped with a modified version of *wpa_supplicant* *affected* by the *all-0 key problem*. Given the diffusion of this operating system, the impact of the Key Reinstallation Attack is critical nevertheless.
